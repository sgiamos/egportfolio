                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">“Round Draw” is a strategy based, two player game, filled with chance that is played, like checkers but on a circular shaped game board. The objective of the game is to be the last man standing. In order to win, one of the players must only have their remaining pieces left on the board.</p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">In a Physical Computing Studio course I took, we were introduced to physical computing, Arduino, and the basics of working with a breadboard. The final project was to create physical models based off what we learned from the labs. I decided to combine this course with&nbsp;an IT Game Architecture and Design course, where I was tasked to create a physical game. This was to be completed during a four month period.</p>

It is an LED lit game board, that is sure to keep the game filled with suspense, every push of a button. Players must position their pieces, leveraging a diverse set of game-changing cards. Each draw has the potential to change the tides of battle. Fought on a dynamic board, no piece is safe once the lights change. Take advantage of the board and the cards to defeat the opponent.<br><br>There are 60 LED lights that are running through the board, 8 of which are RGB LED lights that can change to any color we suggest within the code that was written for the game to be played properly. The LED lights indicate where a players pieces are supposed to be on the board. Similar to checkers, the spaces are lit blue and white. The blue spaces are the areas that are to be played on and the white are to remain empty throughout gameplay. They also indicate if a player has to remove pieces from the board due to the color changing RGB LEDs that are integrated with regular LEDs as well.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style align-left mb-5 display-7">I had gone through several steps towards making my idea solid. I went back into many of our Arduino labs and found two that seemed like they could work for what I had envisioned for my project. We created websites throughout the semester where we documented all of the labs we had done with pictures and videos. The first lab I redid was lab seven, button pressing. I wanted to integrate a button, which would then control the lights changing throughout the game. When the button was pushed they would change the eight RGBs to another color other than blue, which would indicate that the players who were on those spaces had to remove their pieces from the board.<br><br>I went on to find lab twelve, which was called colorful light. I had put together both of the labs on the breadboard we received with our kits and then went into the Arduino application on our computer and combined the two codes. Once I combined the codes, I had to go through and make several changes in order for the two systems to work together. It required a lot of trial and error, going back and forth between the code and the breadboard until I finally started making progress. When I was finally able to get the RGBs to change colors when the button was pushed, I then was able to choose the colors I desired for my game play. Yellow was the alternate color I wanted the lights to change too other than the blue. I chose two colors because it would make game play easier. When the blue lights changed to yellow the players knew that they had to remove their pieces.<br></p>

During the soldering process, I had run out of different colored wire, which led to some soldering confusion between wires. Instead of the RGB LED lights changing colors, pushing the button now would shut the RGB lights off. This did not change how the objective of game, just an adjustment to the rules and what players should expect.<br><br>For the game base, I purchased wood and cut them into 12" pieces with 45 degree cuts on the ends to create the frame. Then I cut a 3/4" slit into all four pieces of the frame for the acrylic to slide in, where the game pieces will be placed. Below, i cut 2.5" high blocks to hold up the plywood that is below the acrylic glass to hide the wiring. Finally, I etched the acrylic at the laser cutter to the specifications of my game board.<br></p>
